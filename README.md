Snorkel: A simple verified toy compiler for a toy language
==========================================================

This project is being written to form the basis of my
University of Cambridge BA Computer Science Part II
dissertation.

It's going to be a compiler for a toy language, namely
the language presented in [Part IB Semantics](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/teaching/1415/Semantics/notes.pdf).

This README will be extended when my code is more complete.
If you somehow have access to this code, you are welcome to
